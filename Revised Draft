PROJECT TITLE: Iskollet: A Scholar Finance Tracker App

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
*Iskollet* is a mobile application designed to help scholars efficiently manage their stipends and allowances. It serves as a digital finance tracker that allows users to record their income, monitor expenses, and set savings goals. Through this app, scholars can develop better budgeting habits and gain financial discipline, ensuring their allowances are used wisely throughout the month.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many scholars struggle with properly managing their stipends and allowances. Without clear budgeting, they often run out of money before the next allowance, preventing them from reaching simple goals such as buying new shoes or saving for personal needs. There is a need for a system that can track spending, encourage saving, and help scholars manage their finances effectively.
